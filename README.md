## Checklists

Here you'll find checklists for:

1. D-ESSU - BR23 BRM Aero Bristel B23 915 IFR (EN)
2. D-MMDX - C42  Comco Icarus C-42B  (DE)
3. D-MMDY - PNR2 Alpi Pioneer 200 (DE)

For the checklists a template (preamble and makefile) which is a fork from [Sophie's "checklists"](https://github.com/miss-sophie/checklists) was used.
